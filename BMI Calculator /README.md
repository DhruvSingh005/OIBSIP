# Advanced BMI Calculator

## Project Description

The Advanced BMI Calculator is a graphical tool built with Python and Tkinter that allows users to compute their Body Mass Index (BMI) and categorize it based on health ranges. In addition to calculating the BMI, the application stores historical data and displays a trend analysis of BMI records over time.

## Features

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design using Tkinter.
BMI Calculation: Computes BMI using user-provided weight (kg) and height (m).
BMI Categorization: Classifies BMI into Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, and Obesity.
Data Storage: Stores BMI records in a JSON file for future reference.
BMI Trend Visualization: Displays historical BMI trends using Matplotlib.
Error Handling: Ensures valid user input with graceful error messaging.

## Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language.
Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
Matplotlib: For visualizing BMI trends.
JSON: For storing historical BMI data.
