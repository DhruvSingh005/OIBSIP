## Chat Application

## Project Description

The Chat Application is designed to facilitate real-time messaging between users. It includes a basic client-server model implemented in Python. This project features two components: a server script that manages multiple client connections and a client script for sending and receiving messages.

## Features

Real-Time Messaging: Enables real-time communication between users.
Client-Server Model: Implements a basic client-server architecture using sockets.
Multi-Client Support: The server can handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
Broadcasting Messages: Messages sent by one client are broadcasted to all connected clients.

## Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language.
Sockets: For network communication.
Threading: To handle multiple clients concurrently.

## Packages Required

Python: Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
No additional external libraries are required for this basic implementation, as it uses built-in Python libraries.

## How to Run the Project

# Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/DhruvSingh005/OIBSIP.git

# Navigate to the project directory:

cd OIBSIP/Chat_Application

# Run the server script:

python server.py

# In a separate terminal, run the client script:

python client.py

## Usage Instructions

Start the server by running server.py.
Run client.py in separate terminals or different machines to connect to the server.
Type messages in the client terminal to send them to other connected clients.
Received messages from other clients will be displayed in the client terminal.
